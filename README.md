## 🔎 Project Overview
This project is based on a **real-world business problem** I solved at **Company X**.  
The goal was to build a **Commercial Dashboard** in Power BI, combining both **Exception Monitoring** and **Logistics Tracking** for outsourcing operations.  

For confidentiality, the data shown here is **dummy / anonymized** while maintaining the **same structure, rules, and logics** as the actual project.  
👉 This ensures the business problem is clearly demonstrated while respecting organizational data privacy.
